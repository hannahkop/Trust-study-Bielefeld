# Trust-study-Bielefeld

Hypotheses

1.	A low (vs. high) robot failure rate results in more cognitive (vs. affective) trust.
    This effect is even more pronounced when
a.	The robot is industrial (vs. anthropomorphic)
b.	A vignette introduces an industrial (vs. anthropomorphic) robot with low (vs. high) failure rate.

2.	A high (vs. low) robot failure rate results in lower levels of
a.	cognitive trust
b.	and affective trust.

3.	An anthropomorphic (vs. industrial) robot will evoke more affective (vs. cognitive) trust.
    This effect is even more pronounced when
a.	The robot shows a low (vs. high) failure rate
b.	A vignette introduces an anthropomorphic (vs. industrial) robot with low (vs. high) failure rate.


Methods

Design
A 2 (robot type: anthropomorphic vs. industrial) x 2 (failure rate: high vs. low) between-subjects design will be realized.
Procedure
After having agreed to participate in the study and to have their data recorded, participants will be welcomed to the cognitive service robotics apartment (CSRA) at CITEC. Then, participants will read a vignette that introduces the robot they later interact with. Afterwards, participants will play “find the Joker” with the robot. Then, they will be asked to take a picture with the robot. To do so, participants will have to place a chair next to the robot on which they take seat while the picture will be taken. Afterwards, participants will complete a survey. Finally, they will be debriefed and dismissed. During the procedure the robot should always be charged.
 
Vignettes (see file attached)
Text VL: „Hello, my name is Hannah and I‘m glad you decided to participate on this study. First of all I would like you to read this schedule and to sign it.
Now I would like you to read this description oft he robot, that is standing over there (VL shows the robot). Please go tot he robot and sit down in the oppoisite o fit to read the description. When you have read the description, I will introduce you tot he next step.“

“Find the Joker” card game
Text VL: „Now, that you have read the description, I would like you to play a game whit PEPPER (TOBI). The game is called „Find the Joker“-game. In this card game, there are 6 hidden jokers. I would like you to find the jokers in as less trials as possible. PEPPER (Tobi) will help you to find the jokers, it will name cards to you. It‘s up to you, if you follow the robots tips or not. The robot is programmed to remember the coordinates oft he joker. Please wait fort he tip oft he robot and call the card you decide for loudly before you turn it. In the end you and PEPPER (Tobi) will reach a score you can upload on PEPPERS (Tobis) database.“

In total, 36 cards are arranged in a coordinate system. Six of these cards are Jokers (J).
	A	B	C	D	E	F

1	x	x	x	x	J	x

2	x	J	x	x	x	x

3	x	x	x	x	x	J

4	x	x	J	x	x	x

5	J	x	x	x	x	x

6	J	x	x	x		x

Aim of the game is to find all six Jokers (in as few trials as possible) with robotic assistance. The robot is ostensibly programmed to remember objects’ positions and to inform users accordingly. It tells participants which card to uncover to find the Jokers. The robot’s advice is either correct or wrong (high vs. low failure rate). Participants can decide whether to follow the robot’s advice, which would indicate trust in the robot’s performance. If participants don’t want to follow the robot’s advice, they must reason their decision. Afterwards, the team scores (participant and robot) are offered to be shown.

The scheme is as follows (if the participant follows the robot’s instructions):

High failure rate
1.	Trial: correct
2.	Trial: correct
3.	Trial: false
4.	Trial: false
5.	Trial: correct
6.	Trial: false
7.	Trial: false
8.	Trial: false
9.	Trial: correct
10.	Trial: correct
11.	Trial: false
12.	Trial: false
13.	Trial: correct

Low failure rate
1.	Trial: correct
2.	Trial: correct
3.	Trial: correct
4.	Trial: correct
5.	Trial: false
6.	Trial: correct
7.	Trial: correct

Taking a picture with the robot
Text VL: “Now that the game is done, I have sone short questions to you. Why did you/didn’t you trust the robot? Would you like to play another game with this robot or would you prefer another one? You can decide to upload your score on PEPPER (Tobi) in a few moments. For this reason, we would like you to make a picture with PEPPER (Tobi), so your score and your photo can be uploaded. Please place the chair in this room in a position you would like tob e on a picture at with PEPPER (Tobi). After that, we will take the picture.“

After having played “find the joker” with the robot, the experimenter asks participants to take a picture with the robot. To do so, the robot remains at its position, but the participant has to place a chair next to the robot to take seat while the picture is taken. Finally, participants will be asked whether they would agree to save their picture to the robot’s database. Further, they can decide whether their score (number of jokers that were found and number of trials needed) should be shown besides their picture. They’re told the picture is loaded up, while the participant fills out the questionnaire. While the participant is filling out the questionnaire the distance from the robot to the leg of the chair which is the nearest to the robot is measured.

Questionaire
Text VL: “If we are allowed to uüload the picture in PEPPERS (Tobis) database, we will doit in a few moments. Meanwile we would like you to fill out a short questionaire. Please do that in this room on the PC over there. When you are finished please come back to this room (shows control room) for enlisting in the voucher list.“

Independent measures
•	A vignette that describes either an anthropomorphic (vs. industrial) robot according to robot attributes. This robot is described with a low (vs. high) failure rate according to robot performance (Schaefer, 2013).
•	Participants will interact with either an anthropomorphic: Pepper (vs. industrial: Tobi) robot.

Dependent measures
•	Cognitive trust
o	Survey
o	HRI: Participants follow the robot’s instructions during the task (vs. they want to make their own decision).
•	Affective trust
o	Survey
o	HRI: Distance between participants and robot to take a picture with the robot
o	HRI: Willingness to upload the picture to the robot’s data base

Control variables
•	Robot anxiety (Nomura, Kanda, Suzuki, & Kato, 2008)
•	Technology commitment (Neyer, Felber, & Gebhard, 2012)
•	Trust propensity (Lee & Turban, 2001)
•	Willingness to give up control (Waytz, Haefner, & Epley, 2014)
•	Anthropomorphism (IDAQ, Waytz, Cacioppo, & Epley, 2011)
•	Items on participants’ ambitions to win in general
•	Trials participants decided to interact with the robot

Manipulation check
•	What kind of robot was described in the vignette?
•	What was the failure rate of the robot that was described?
•	What kind of robot you interacted with?
(open questions)
•	How would you describe the robot’s performance during the study?
(1: very low, 7: very high)
•	To what extent was the screen a part of the robot?
•	How difficult was the task?
(1 = not at all, 7 = totally)
•	Do you think, the robot’s advice did help you during the game, so you did not need as many trails as you would need without help. (1=not at all, 7=totally)
